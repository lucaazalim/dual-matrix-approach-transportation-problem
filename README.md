This Java implementation demonstrates the Dual-Matrix Approach for solving the Transportation Problem, as proposed by Ping Ji and K. F. Chu in their paper, "A Dual-Matrix Approach to the Transportation Problem" (`paper.pdf`) published in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Operational Research, Volume 19, 2002, pages 35-45.

This implementation was developed as an assignment for the Graph Theory and Computability course, during the fourth semester of the Software Engineering program at PUC Minas. The complete assignment description is available in `assignment.pdf`.
